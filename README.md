# Usage Attribution — Reference

This repository provides a **versioned reference specification**
for **usage attribution semantics** in machine-to-machine and system-to-system environments.

Usage attribution describes how **measurable activity**
is deterministically linked to an **accountable entity**,
independent of billing, settlement, or payment execution.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to establish **shared semantic boundaries**
for attributing usage prior to any billing or settlement logic.

It supports:
- reproducible attribution outcomes,
- auditability across system boundaries,
- and interoperability between independent implementations.

---

## What This Repository Is

- A **reference layer** for usage attribution semantics
- A **non-commercial**, non-vendor specification
- A **machine-readable** and versioned documentation set

---

## What This Repository Is Not

This repository does **not**:
- define billing or settlement rules,
- provide pricing or payment services,
- prescribe architectures or tools,
- certify systems or implementations,
- offer legal or regulatory guidance.
